FastCubo offers an optimized interface for creating and managing data cubes, enabling operations up to 10 times faster than traditional methods. Whether you're working with single images, collections, or complex computations, FastCubo provides the tools you need to handle large datasets efficiently. Key Features \u2728 Fast Image and Collection downloads : Retrieve images and image collections from GEE with unparalleled speed, leveraging multi-threaded downloads. \ud83d\udce5 Efficient data cube management : Split large images into smaller, manageable sub-cubes for optimized processing. \ud83e\udde9 Compute pixels with ease : Perform complex pixel computations directly on GEE images, with results efficiently processed and downloaded. \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Scalable to large datasets : Handle large-scale data without compromising performance, thanks to advanced memory and processing optimizations. \ud83d\udcc8 Installation \u2699\ufe0f Install the latest version from PyPI: pip install fastcubo How to use \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Download a ee.Image \ud83c\udf0d import ee import fastcubo ee .
